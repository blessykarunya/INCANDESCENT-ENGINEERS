This part of the project, damage detection is done using Lobe. Lobe is a Microsoft acquired AI startup that provides a platform to implement code-free A.I. related functions.

This application is made use of here. 

Images are fed to the application and trained to detect damaged car parts.

Once the model is trained, we can give an image and detect the damaged carparts automatically with just the image as input.
